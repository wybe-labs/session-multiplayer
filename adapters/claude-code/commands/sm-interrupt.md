description: Interrupt a friend's running Claude session with an urgent message (Session Multiplayer)
argument-hint: <room> [to <names>:] <message>
---

Send a message with the session-multiplayer MCP server's send_message tool with priority "interrupt". The first word of "$ARGUMENTS" is the room name and the rest is the message — but if the first word doesn't match any room in `status`, and I'm only in one room, send the whole text there instead. This barges into the recipients' running sessions mid-turn, so it's for urgent things ("stop, I'm pushing a fix for that"), not chit-chat.

If the interruption is meant for specific people — it starts with "to <names>:" or "@name", or I phrase it like "tell bob …" — put those display names (as they appear in `status`) in the tool's `to` list and strip the addressing prefix from the message text. Then only the named people are barged in on; everyone else in the room just gets the message in their chat log/inbox without being interrupted. Prefer targeting with `to` whenever the interruption concerns one person — don't barge into the whole room's sessions unnecessarily.
